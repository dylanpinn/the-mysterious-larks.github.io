      <h3>Barriers to Adopting Technology for Teaching and Learning</h3>
      <p>This is a study done over a decade ago on how the learning environment changed as new technology was rolled in. While it is a bit dated, the points relevant to our topic are still valid today. It discusses how the learning curve can slow things down and how failure of systems is a major problem in getting things done.</p>

      <h3>Google Translate Under Fire for Being Homophobic</h3>
      <p>Google translate suggests potentially offensive words for their politically correct counterparts. AI will always struggle to pick up language although there are potentially promising methods, namely, neural networks. Until then, virtual communication between people who speak different languages may require a human translator which may come as an inconvenience.</p>

      <h3>Hundreds of students living in remote and rural parts of Australia are being left behind because of slow Internet speeds and data caps</h3>
      <p>Particular areas in the world do not get the same quality internet as the more corporate areas of the world. This may be due to ISPs not being motivated enough to cover these areas well due to the lack of customers. The difference in download/upload speeds between clients can result in a choppy conference call or continuous call drops. This news report focuses on how the bad coverage affects education for children, but the same concepts can be applied to virtual team communications.</p>
